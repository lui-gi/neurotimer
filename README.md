# neurotimer

neurotimer is a science-based study timer designed to optimize learning efficiency. Unlike standard Pomodoro timers that simply track time, neurotimer manages cognitive load and memory encoding by operationalizing proven psychological principles into a single-page web application.

## Core Methodology

The application moves beyond blocked practice by automating the following cognitive science techniques:

### Interleaving
The timer automatically switches between different subjects within a single session. This forces the brain to constantly reload context, improving discrimination learning and long-term retention.

### Priming
Before a study block begins, a dedicated "Priming" phase prompts the user to read over the big ideas of the topic that they are studying, such as the chapter titles, unit names, etc.

### Chunking
The interface encourages breaking large subjects into specific, bite-sized tasks to respect working memory limits.

### Elaborative Interrogation
Upon session completion, the user is prompted to answer "Why" questions regarding the material, facilitating deep encoding rather than passive review.

### Spaced Repetition
At the end of a study session, the site urges the user to study again at a calculated date in order to foster deep learning.
