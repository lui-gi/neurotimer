# neurotimer

neurotimer is a science-based study timer designed to optimize learning efficiency. Unlike standard Pomodoro timers that simply track time, neurotimer manages cognitive load and memory encoding by operationalizing proven psychological principles into a single-page web application.

Core Methodology

The application moves beyond blocked practice by automating the followåing cognitive science techniques:

Interleaving: The timer automatically switches between different subjects within a single session. This forces the brain to constantly reload context, improving discrimination learning and long-term retention.

Priming: Before a study block begins, a dedicated "Priming" phase displays upcoming topics to pre-activate relevant mental models and neural pathways.

Chunking: The interface encourages breaking large subjects into specific, bite-sized tasks to respect working memory limits.

Elaborative Interrogation: Upon session completion, the user is prompted to answer "Why" questions regarding the material, facilitating deep encoding rather than passive review.

Spaced Repetition: An underlying algorithm creates a review schedule based on the user's self-reported difficulty rating.
